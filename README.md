Chess Rules: 

Chess is a two-player strategy game played on a checkered gameboard. The gameboard consists of 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid. The squares are alternately colored light and dark, with the light squares being in the bottom right corner for each player.

Each player begins the game with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The pieces are placed on the board as follows:

Rooks are placed in the corners
Knights are placed next to the rooks
Bishops are placed next to the knights
Queen is placed on her color square (white queen on light square, black queen on dark square)
King is placed next to the queen
The objective of the game is to checkmate your opponent's king. This occurs when the king is in a square that is attacked by one of your pieces and cannot escape capture.

The game is played in turns, with White moving first. Each turn, a player must move one of their pieces to a different square on the board. The following are the rules for moving each piece:

Pawn:

A pawn moves forward one square, but captures diagonally.
On its first move, a pawn may move forward two squares.
Pawns have the special ability to capture en passant.
Rook:

A rook moves horizontally or vertically, as far as it wants.
Knight:

A knight moves in an L-shape: two squares in a straight line in any direction and then one square to the side.
Bishop:

A bishop moves diagonally, as far as it wants.
Queen:

A queen moves horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, as far as she wants.
King:

A king moves one square in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
The king has a special move called castling, which involves moving the king two squares towards a rook, and then moving the rook to the square the king crossed.
When a player puts their opponent's king in check, the opponent must get out of check on their next move. If a player is not able to get out of check, the game ends in checkmate and the player who put the king in check wins the game. If a player's king is not in check, but the player has no legal moves, the game is a draw (called a stalemate).
